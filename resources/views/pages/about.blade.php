                <h3>Brand Story</h3>
                <p>Hong Kong, a global city with an outlook that combines the best of both East and the West; a testament to its cosmopolitan effect. A city bustling with life as people go about their business, trying to earn a living through various activities, others touring the place. However, with all that goes on in our daily hustles, everyone has to eat at some point and replenish their energy reserves.</p>
                <p><em>EC Bento</em> is a new company, founded with the aim of revolutionizing the way that hot meals are delivered. By developing unique, intelligent vending machines which are able to provide hot meals on-site, the need for queues and the risk of running late waiting on a delivery are, effectively, circumvented. Not only does EC Bento provide a convenient alternative to facing traffic at the peak of the lunchtime rush hour, but it also ensures that your food is always prepared and delivered to you just the way you like it, fresh and steaming hot.</p>
                <p>Our intelligent vending machine is unlike any other hot meal machine in the market. Innovatively crafted and designed, it maintains a temperature of over 60°C, ideal for keeping food as fresh, clean, and contamination-free once our supplier has delivered food into it. All meals are made freshly every day by local licensed food factories.</p>
                <p>Currently, we are rapidly expanding the locations in which our intelligent vending machines may be found. Our goal is to provide a quality yet convenient food solution for the busy working people of Hong Kong, to spare them having their time wasted spent waiting, whilst offering them their choice of freshly made food selected from an extensive menu, any time they so choose.</p>
                <p>The EC Bento intelligent hot meal vending machine is the way to go, where quality and convenience blend. Why are you still waiting on a delivery?</p>
